## Expected Video Files:
- `zone_a.mp4` - Main stage area footage
- `zone_b.mp4` - Food court area footage  
- `zone_c.mp4` - Parking area footage
- `zone_d.mp4` - Emergency services area footage

## Video Requirements:
- Format: MP4, AVI, or MOV
- Resolution: 720p or higher recommended
- Duration: Any length (system will extract frames automatically)
- Content: Should show crowd/event scenarios for analysis

## For Testing:
If you don't have actual video files, you can:

3. Download sample crowd footage from free video sites

The system will process these videos to extract frames for AI analysis.
